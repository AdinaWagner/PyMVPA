However, the corresponding library is available from the libsvm source
package (or rather the binary packages it builds). Therefore this code is
not used and the respective packages are used as dependencies. This copy of
the libsvm code is, however, left in place, as it does not hurt and does
not justify repackaging of the upstream sources.
