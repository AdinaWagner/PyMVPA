pymvpa (0.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Removing the circular dependency between python-mvpa and python-mvpa-lib
    (Closes: #519129).
  * Improve long description of python-mvpa-lib and turn it into complete
    sentences, as recommended by the developers reference 6.2.3
    (Closes: #521332).
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1 -- no changes necessary.
  * Added dependency on python to the python-mvpa package to satisfy lintian.
  * Added rsync as build-dependency, which is required for building the docs.
  * The package now honors 'nodoc' in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. This is intended to
    help backporting to releases with insufficient python-sphinx versions.
  * Added 'graphviz' as a build-dependency (necessary for Sphinx' inheritance
    graphs).

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * Compatible with cdbs >= 0.4.54 (use of DEB_PYTHON_MODULE_PACKAGES) and
    recent pysupport (>=0.9).
  * Run unittests for each supported python version during build.

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Added missing ${misc:Depends} to debian/control.
  * The package now honors 'nocheck' in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * Speed-up of package build process by preventing the docs from being built
    twice.
  * Added 'DM-Upload-Allowed: yes' to enable DM upload.
  * Install new manpages and add build-dep. to help2man.
  * Updated debian/copyright.
  * Imported various bugfixes from the upstream VCS that were pushed into the
    0.4 maintenance branch since the release of 0.4.1.

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * Adjusted long descriptions.
  * Split libraries (low-level SMLR implementation and LIBSVM custom
    Python bindings) into a separate python-mvpa-lib package. That allows
    python-mvpa package to become architecture independent.
